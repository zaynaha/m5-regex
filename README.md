# Instructions

This mini assignment gives you practice with regex in Java.
You will implement three methods that use Java in different
ways to work with regex to perform common tasks. 

- [ ] Create your own copy of this template repo.

- [ ] Complete the three methods in class [Main](src/main/java/regex/Main.java) so that they pass the provided `MainTest`
     tests in class [MainTests](src/test/java/regex/MainTest.java).

  > Note: you will earn full credit as long as the provided tests pass.
  >
  > While there are **no hidden tests** for this assignment, we do encourage you
  > to still write your own additional test cases, as the provided test set does not cover
  > _all_ edge cases. When creating a regex, it is important to both think
  > of which strings it _should_ match and which strings it _should not_ match.

- [ ] Ensure that you have committed and pushed your work to your repo on GitHub.

- [ ] On MarkUs, submit a link to your GitHub repo.
  > **Run the self tests to confirm that your submission is complete.**
